If you've got an idea on how to make this site better, you've got a couple options for contributing.

## Open an Issue

If you're not all that familiar with coding, you can <a :href="site.repoissues">open an issue on GitHub</a> with details on your idea and the site maintainers will consider your recommendation.

## Create a Pull Request

If you're comfortable doing development yourself, you can <a :href="site.repo">go to the site's GitHub repo</a>, do the development yourself, and create a pull request with your proposed changes. The maintainers of this site will take a look at your proposed changes, test them, and merge the PR if everything checks out and we find the changes are in line with the site's purpose.
