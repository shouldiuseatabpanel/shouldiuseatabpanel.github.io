## Patterns used on this site

To help increase accessibility, the following patterns were borrowed from:

- The tab panel is a modified version of the [tabs with automatic activation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/examples/tabs-automatic/) pattern from the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/)'s [Web Accessibility Initiative.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) The pattern has been styled differently and a few modifications have been made to the underlying HTML code so they will work as [webc components](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/webc/) with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), the static site generator used to build this site.
- The focus style is a slightly modified version of the [universal focus state](https://www.erikkroes.nl/blog/the-universal-focus-state/) by [Erik Kroes.](https://www.erikkroes.nl/)
